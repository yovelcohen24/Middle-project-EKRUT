# Middle-project-EKRUT
"In the corner of the hall there is a wonderful machine 'Electric Carot'.
Bold people can approach her, choose to their heart's content a snack or a drink from the selection displayed behind her
On the glass side of the machine, deposit an appropriate amount of money (according to the helicopter you chose - the prices are shown in the window),
Then get what they want. If the product is missing, an alternative will be displayed to choose from. For the benefit of the dead it is possible
Change or deselect at any time. The truth is that you have to click the 'Accept' button to accept the selection.
For the purpose of realizing the project, the snack division (PSB Bars Snack Paradise) was established, which is a chain of
operational areas. Each area has several points of sale (on campuses, public institutions, workplaces)
Where is the Krut Electrical sales robot installed.
The director general of the division.
